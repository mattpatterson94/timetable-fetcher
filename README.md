## Timetable Fetcher

### Author

Matt Patterson

### Summary

Timetable Fetcher is used to retrieve timetables for things such as Gyms, Trains, Yoga Studios etc.

It's super modular so new places can easily be added by creating a few files.

It allows printing to STDIN or to JSON so you can then use the timetable as you see fit.

### Supported Places

* [Kaya Health Clubs](https://kayahealthclubs.com.au/)

### Developing

To create a new supported place, follow how the Kaya setup is done and implement it in a similar way.

### Testing

TBA.
